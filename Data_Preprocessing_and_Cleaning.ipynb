This movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want that you can rent something from the \\\"Adult\\\" section.

Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted \\u0096 just the thick-headed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View, passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father, an impudent, violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the Pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles all influence eachother, but each is seperate, and utterly unique. He changes completely, with each character he takes on. And I'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything. Anything.<br /><br />As Cristy Brown he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character, and he does not pity the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human.<br /><br />This movie, despite small scene-transition faults and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it's predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isn't a Hollywood movie.<br /><br />My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. \\\"I'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated.\\\" \\\"Wheel out the cripple!\\\" And his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again again, and I never get tired of Cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />A must-see. Fo sho, yo!\",\n          \"Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I've ever seen. Sort of like a high school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking?? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town? Pretty hard to get involved with this one. No lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that intrigues you) videotaped nonsense....What was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. And what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? Give this one a pass, it's like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa.....\",\n          \"Taut and organically gripping, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely \\\"message\\\" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.<br /><br />Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who's assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to insure his silence before Young closes in.<br /><br />Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan, naturally, does his prototypical Angry White Male (and to the hilt), while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.<br /><br />The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). At least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and...).<br /><br />Curiously, Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).<br /><br />But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. The victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating Ryan's murderous rage.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

no. i laughed. i cried. not a single moment of cheese. proof that this isn't a hollywood movie.<br /><br />my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when cristy is discussing painters with eileen, peter and her friends. here's where daniel day-lewis reaches an acting climax. \\\"i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated.\\\" \\\"wheel out the cripple!\\\" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />a must-see. fo sho, yo!\",\n          \"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking?? and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town? pretty hard to get involved with this one. no lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that intrigues you) videotaped nonsense....what was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. and what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? give this one a pass, it's like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa.....\",\n          \"taut and organically gripping, edward dmytryk's crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely \\\"message\\\" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.<br /><br />bivouacked in washington, dc, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where robert ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (sam levene) to death because he happens to be jewish. police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum, who's assigned to ryan's outfit. suspicion falls on the second of the three (george cooper), who has vanished. ryan slays the third buddy (steve brodie) to insure his silence before young closes in.<br /><br />abetted by a superior script by john paxton, dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs. ryan, naturally, does his prototypical angry white male (and to the hilt), while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); young may never have been better. gloria grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, paul kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.<br /><br />the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to young's reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). at least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why ryan hates jews (and hillbillies and...).<br /><br />curiously, crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (richard brooks' the brick foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. news of the holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of europe, so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).<br /><br />but while the change from homophobia to anti-semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. the victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating ryan's murderous rage.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

no. i laughed. i cried. not a single moment of cheese. proof that this isn't a hollywood movie.my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when cristy is discussing painters with eileen, peter and her friends. here's where daniel day-lewis reaches an acting climax. \\\"i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated.\\\" \\\"wheel out the cripple!\\\" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.a must-see. fo sho, yo!\",\n          \"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking??

no. i laughed. i cried. not a single moment of cheese. proof that this isn't a hollywood movie.my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when cristy is discussing painters with eileen, peter and her friends. here's where daniel day-lewis reaches an acting climax. \\\"i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated.\\\" \\\"wheel out the cripple!\\\" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.a must-see. fo sho, yo!\",\n          \"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking??

of the father an impudent violent butcher in gangs of new york in a performance ten times stronger than adrian brodys in the pianist and as the outrageous cristy brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot just to name a few his roles all influence eachother but each is seperate and utterly unique he changes completely with each character he takes on and im beginning to believe that he can act as anything anythingas cristy brown he is stunning he does not ridicule the character and he does not pity the character a difficult achievement and cristy brown comes to life a smart man an outrageous man humanthis movie despite small scenetransition faults and the like is an inspiration yes its predictable but is it stupidly sentimental no i laughed i cried not a single moment of cheese proof that this isnt a hollywood moviemy favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when cristy is discussing painters with eileen peter and her friends heres where daniel daylewis reaches an acting climax ill kick you in the only part of your anatomy thats animated wheel out the cripple and his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful simply he has a lot of screen time here i watch it again again and i never get tired of cristys perspicacious eyes twitching and guttural speechesa mustsee fo sho yo\",\n          \"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film ive ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsensewhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass its like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa\",\n          \"taut and organically gripping edward dmytryks crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cyclebivouacked in washington dc a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars three of them end up at a strangers apartment where robert ryan drunk and belligerent beats their host sam levene to death because he happens to be jewish police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum whos assigned to ryans outfit suspicion falls on the second of the three george cooper who has vanished ryan slays the third buddy steve brodie to insure his silence before young closes inabetted by a superior script by john paxton dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs ryan naturally does his prototypical angry white male and to the hilt while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance his role however is not central young may never have been better gloria grahame gives her first fullyfledged rendition of the smartmouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack whos leeched into her life paul kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorablethe politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but its pretty much confined to youngs reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit at least theres no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why ryan hates jews and hillbillies andcuriously crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it  the novel its based on richard brooks the brick foxhole dealt with a gaybashing murder but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale news of the holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of europe so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against antisemitism the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyerbut while the change from homophobia to antisemitism works in general the specifics dont fit so smoothly the victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since theres a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating ryans murderous rage\"\n

foot just to name a few his roles all influence eachother but each is seperate and utterly unique he changes completely with each character he takes on and im beginning to believe that he can act as anything anythingas cristy brown he is stunning he does not ridicule the character and he does not pity the character a difficult achievement and cristy brown comes to life a smart man an outrageous man humanthis movie despite small scenetransition faults and the like is an inspiration yes its predictable but is it stupidly sentimental no i laughed i cried not a single moment of cheese proof that this isnt a hollywood moviemy favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when cristy is discussing painters with eileen peter and her friends heres where daniel daylewis reaches an acting climax ill kick you in the only part of your anatomy thats animated wheel out the cripple and his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful simply he has a lot of screen time here i watch

young investigates with the help of robert mitchum whos assigned to ryans outfit suspicion falls on the second of the three george cooper who has vanished ryan slays the third buddy steve brodie to insure his silence before young closes inabetted by a superior script by john paxton dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs ryan naturally does his prototypical angry white male and to the hilt while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance his role however is not central young may never have been better gloria grahame gives her first fullyfledged rendition of the smartmouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack whos leeched into her life paul kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorablethe politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but its pretty much confined to youngs reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit at least theres no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why ryan hates jews and hillbillies andcuriously crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it  the novel its based on richard brooks the brick foxhole dealt with a gaybashing murder but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale news of the holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of europe so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against antisemitism the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyerbut while the change from homophobia to antisemitism works in general the specifics dont fit so smoothly the victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since theres a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating ryans murderous rage\"\n

this isnt a hollywood moviemy favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when cristy is discussing painters with eileen peter and her friends heres where daniel daylewis reaches an acting climax ill kick you in the only part of your anatomy thats animated wheel out the cripple and his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful simply he has a lot of screen time here i watch

rendition of the smartmouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack whos leeched into her life paul kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorablethe politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but its pretty much confined to youngs reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit at least theres no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why ryan hates jews and hillbillies andcuriously crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it  the novel its based on richard brooks the brick foxhole dealt with a gaybashing murder but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale news of the holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of europe so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against antisemitism the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyerbut while the change from homophobia to antisemitism works in general the specifics dont fit so smoothly the victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since theres a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating ryans murderous rage\"\n
